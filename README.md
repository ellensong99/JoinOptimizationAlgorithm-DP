# JoinOptimizationAlgorithm-DP
This is simple join optimization algorithm, JOA for short, for an RDBMS implemented using Dynamic Programming to find the lowest cost plan for a natural chain join query **Q** in terms of $R0(A_0, A_1) ◃▹ R_1(A_1, A_2) . . . R_{n−2}(A_{n−2}, A_{n−1}) ◃▹ R_{n−1}(A_{n−1}, A_n)$
